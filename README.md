# TicTacToe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
